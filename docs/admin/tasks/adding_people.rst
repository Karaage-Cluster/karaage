Adding people
-------------

There are two ways of adding a new person to Karaage. One is that the person
accesses karaage-registration, and places a request to join a project or create
a new project. This request must then be approved by the project leader
(existing project), or institute delegate (new project), and a system
administrator. The other way is for a system administrator to add the person in
karaage-admin.

If you are an administrator and want to add a person:

1. Check there is an institute appropriate for the person, under Institutes. If not, add an institute.
2. If person is to join a project, check the project already exists, under Projects. If not, add the project.
3. Check if the person already exists, under People. If not, add the person.
