.. index:: upgrading; to 3.0.x

Upgrading to 3.0.x
==================
This section is for administrators who have an older version of Karaage already
installed, and wish to upgrade to 3.0.x.

If you don't already have Karaage installed and wish to get started for the
first time, please see the :doc:`/upgrading` section.

.. warning::

    This is a non-trivial upgrade with non-trivial database migrations. The
    database migrations will take some time to complete and could fail or cause
    data loss. It is recommended that you copy your production data and run the
    database migrations on a test system, as shown below.


Assumptions
-----------
Assumptions made by this documentation. Other configurations are possible,
however you will have to adapt from this documentation.

* You have a cluster running Slurm or PBS that is already up and running.
* You want to OpenLDAP with ppolicy support, on the same server.
* You have a Debian Wheezy server already setup for Karaage.
* You will be upgrading all components on a single system, called production.
* You will do the upgrade via a testbox, called testbox, so you can test the new karaage before being commited.


Backup production box
---------------------

.. warning::

    Any changes to database while after the backup, but before the upgrade is
    finished, may be lost. It is recommended to shutdown Karaage before running
    the final run to ensure important changes are not made.

Backup various things on production box:

#.  Backup /etc/karaage and everything under this directory.

#.  Backup /etc/ldap or /etc/openldap and everything under this directory.

#.  Dump mysql database on production box.

    .. code-block:: bash

        mysqldump karaage > karaage.sql

    You will use this file in the next step.

#.  Dump LDAP database on production box.

    .. code-block:: bash

        slapcat > karaage.ldif


Install on test server
----------------------
.. warning::

    Double check what you are doing to ensure you don't accidentally delete
    production data.

.. warning::

    You must have sufficient disk space on the production box to create a copy
    of the Karaage database.

.. note::

    The migrations do not make any invasive changes to LDAP in any way until
    you run migrate_ldap, manually, by hand. This can be done after testing
    everything to make sure it is working fine. This means you don't need to
    copy LDAP data from your test system to your production system.

    If any institute references a group by gidNumber that does not exist, and
    cannot be found by name either, it will automatically be created. Not
    having a group is an error, even for Karaage 2.7.x.

.. note::

    If you do encounter any problems performing database migrations, please file
    a bug report, so the problem can be fixed. Bug reports can be submitted at
    `github <https://github.com/Karaage-Cluster/karaage/issues>`_.

#.  Create a copy of the karaage database on your production mysql server:

    #.  Create a new user and database for karaage3::

            mysql> create database karaage3;
            mysql> CREATE USER 'karaage3'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YYYYYYYY';
            mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON karaage3.* TO 'karaage3'@'localhost';

        You will use the values you set, later, in the karaage settings. Do not
        use YYYYYYYY on a production system.

        It is recommended that the user karaage3 should not have any access to
        the karaage database, to avoid the potential for mistakes being made.

        You will need to create karaage3 users that can access this database from your test box::

            mysql> CREATE USER 'karaage3'@'testbox' IDENTIFIED BY 'YYYYYYYY';
            mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON karaage3.* TO 'karaage3'@'testbox';

    #.  Copy mysql to new database on production box:

            .. code-block:: bash

                mysql karaage3 < karaage.sql

    #.  Check data in karaage3 looks correct, before proceeding.

#.  Setup a test system.  Read the steps in :doc:`/getting_started`. Do not set
    up any data stores yet. These steps will instruct you to install a mysql
    database, which isn't essential, however does help ensure karaage is
    working correctly at this point.

#.  Stop karaage processes on test box.

    .. code-block:: bash

        service apache2 stop
        service karaage3-celery stop

#.  Check the following settings are in /etc/karaage/global_settings.py. The
    mysql server should refer to the *new* database you created above, the LDAP
    server should refer to your production server.

    .. code-block:: python

        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                'NAME': 'karaage3',
                'USER': 'karaage3',
                'PASSWORD': 'YYYYYYYY',
                'HOST': 'production',
                'PORT': '',
                'ATOMIC_REQUESTS': True,
            }
        }

        LDAP = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'tldap.backend.fake_transactions',
                'URI': 'ldap://production',
                'USER': 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org',
                'PASSWORD': 'XXXXXXXX',
                'USE_TLS': False,
                'TLS_CA' : None,
            }
        }

        DATASTORES = {
            'ldap' : [
                {
                    'DESCRIPTION': 'Default LDAP datastore',
                    'ENGINE': 'karaage.datastores.ldap.AccountDataStore',
                    'LDAP': 'default',
                    'ACCOUNT': 'karaage.datastores.ldap_schemas.openldap_account',
                    'GROUP': 'karaage.datastores.ldap_schemas.openldap_group',
                    'PRIMARY_GROUP': "institute",
                    'DEFAULT_PRIMARY_GROUP': "dummy",
                    'HOME_DIRECTORY': "/home/%(uid)s",
                    'LOCKED_SHELL': "/usr/local/sbin/locked",
                    'LDAP_ACCOUNT_BASE': 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=org',
                    'LDAP_GROUP_BASE': 'ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=org',
                },
            ],
            'dummy' : [
            ],
        }

    Do not set the ``LDAP_PERSON_BASE`` value yet.

    The values given for LDAP_ACCOUNT_BASE and LDAP_GROUP_BASE should
    correspond with your existing LDAP data.

    .. warning::

        You must call the ldap datastore 'ldap' otherwise the migrations will fail to retrieve LDAP
        information correctly.

    .. warning::

        You must have LDAP configured correctly before you proceed to the migration step. The migrations reference
        LDAP information if it is available. If it is not available, the database may end up with incorrect
        information.

#.  Migrate DB tables:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kg-manage migrate --all

    Some of these migrations may take some time to complete.

#.  Check mysql data is correct.

    #.  Connect to mysql database:

            .. code-block:: bash

                mysql karaage3

    #.  Ensure all tables in database are using innodb and utf8 encoding::

            mysql> use karaage3
            mysql> show table status

        For every table that is not innodb, convert it with::

            mysql> ALTER TABLE table_name ENGINE=InnoDB;

        For every table that is not utf8, convert it with::

            mysql> ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci

        Some of these conversions may take some time to complete, especially
        for the cpujob table.

    #.  Ensure mysql data is correct without any obvious signs of problems.

#. If you have any other datastores, configure them now (:doc:`/datastores`).

#.  Restart karaage processes.

    .. code-block:: bash

        service apache2 start
        service karaage3-celery start

#.  You can run the following command to check what LDAP changes are required:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kg-manage update_ldap --ldif

    These need to be run before the upgrade can be considered complete, however
    there is no hurry just yet. If you make the changes now, some operations on your
    production box may not work correctly until after you upgrade.

#.  Test. You should now be able to go to http://hostname/kgadmin/.  Apply any
    local customizations you need to have a fully operational system now.  Do
    not continue if you are not completely happy.


Install on production server
----------------------------

#.  Up to this point you have not made any changes to your production server.
    If you are not happy with the upgrade, you can revert to your production
    system. After you pass this point, it will still be possible to revert,
    only it will be slightly harder, as you have to undo the following steps.

#.  Move /etc/karaage to temp place:

    .. code-block:: bash

        mv /etc/karaage /etc/karaage.old

#.  Make a complete copy of /etc/karaage from test box to production box. Check
    /etc/karaage/global_settings.py and ensure database and LDAP references are
    still correct for the production box.

#.  Install the latest packages on your production box:

    .. code-block:: bash

        apt-get install karaage3-admin
        apt-get install karaage3-registration
        apt-get install python-mysqldb
        apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

    If prompted to replace config files, say No, unless you know what you are
    doing.

    If you have disabled installing recommended packages by default, you will
    need to install these packages by hand:

    .. code-block:: bash

        apt-get install rabbitmq-server
        apt-get install karaage3-celery

#.  Test production box and make sure everything is working.

#.  (optional) If you require people to be recorded in LDAP:

    #.  Add the ``PERSON`` and ``LDAP_PERSON_BASE`` settings to the
        ``ldap`` datastore:

        .. code-block:: python

            DATASTORES = {
                 'ldap' : [
                      {
                            'DESCRIPTION': 'Default LDAP datastore',
                            'ENGINE': 'karaage.datastores.ldap.AccountDataStore',
                            'LDAP': 'default',
                            'PERSON': 'karaage.datastores.ldap_schemas.openldap_person',
                            'ACCOUNT': 'karaage.datastores.ldap_schemas.openldap_account',
                            'GROUP': 'karaage.datastores.ldap_schemas.openldap_group',
                            'PRIMARY_GROUP': "institute",
                            'DEFAULT_PRIMARY_GROUP': "dummy",
                            'HOME_DIRECTORY': "/home/%(uid)s",
                            'LOCKED_SHELL': "/usr/local/sbin/locked",
                            'LDAP_PERSON_BASE': 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=org',
                            'LDAP_ACCOUNT_BASE': 'ou=Accounts,dc=example,dc=org',
                            'LDAP_GROUP_BASE': 'ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=org',
                      },
                 ],
                 # as above
            }

    #.  You may need to reconfigure clients to use ou=People,dc=example,dc=org
        or ou=Accounts,dc=example,dc=org depending on requirements.

#.  Run the following commands to check what LDAP changes are required:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kg-manage update_ldap --ldif

    Make the LDAP changes if happy:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kg-manage update_ldap

#.  Test production box and make sure everything is working.
